# Ducky-Scripts
A collection of the Ducky scripts that i modified / wrote

## What i used
Normally Ducky script is used with a [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe). 
The Rubber Ducky mimics a real keyboard, which makes it possible to run scripts as if you were on the Victims keyboard. Now, i used what's called a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), which esentially is the same thing but cheaper. The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller which you can reprogramm to do the same thing as the Rubber Ducky. Here is a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw) from Network Chuck about that topic.
